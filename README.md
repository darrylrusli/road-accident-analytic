Background: The UK Government has instituted stringent road traffic regulations aimed at mitigating road-related tragedies, encompassing fatalities and severe injuries. However, despite the implementation of these regulations, the incidence of significant injuries and fatalities remains alarmingly elevated. Analysing the data documenting road accidents resulting from non-compliance with traffic regulations provides insights into the factors contributing to the peak accident rates observed between 2021 and 2022.

Key Achievement: From the finding, the fatal severity rate for the bike rider is very high on the single carriage highway which happen between 2021 to 2022. This led into road accident reduction with better compliance with Road Regulation from cyclist.
